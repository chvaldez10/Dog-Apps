## Prerequisites ðŸ“š

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20.11.1 is LTS) ðŸŸ¢
- npm (npm comes with Node.js) ðŸ“¦

You can check your versions by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Step 1: Install all the node modules

```bash
# either command works
npm install

npm i
```

## Step 2: Start Your React App ðŸš€

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the React development server, and your default web browser should open to `http://localhost:3000` automatically, displaying your new React app. If it doesn't open, you can manually navigate to the URL in your browser.
