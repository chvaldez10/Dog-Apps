Originating from Malta, where it is the national dog, the Pharaoh Hound is a sighthound with a rich history as a skilled hunter. Characterized by its sleek and muscular build, distinctive 'blush' when excited, and large, expressive ears, the Pharaoh Hound is as striking as it is athletic. Despite its independent streak, the breed forms strong bonds with its family and is known for its loyalty and affection. While not hypoallergenic, the Pharaoh Hound's short coat requires minimal grooming, making it a relatively low-maintenance breed. With proper socialization and training, the Pharaoh Hound can make a loving and devoted companion for active families and individuals who appreciate its unique qualities and heritage."
